# Hamamoui: Graph Connectivity Maintenance Implementation

This is an implementation of theory presented in Hamamoui's paper [1], maintaining graph connectivity through the matching of unlabled spanning trees.

## Results Preview

_The figure shows an important finding of the paper - that the probabiltiy of a isomorphic match increases with graph order._
